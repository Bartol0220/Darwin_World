# Darwin_World

**Darwin World** is an evolutionary simulation game in which a population of animals lives on a grid-based world consisting of steppes and jungle regions. Animals move, consume plants to gain energy, reproduce using genome crossover with mutation, and gradually evolve over time according to Darwinian selection principles.

The application was implemented in **Java with JavaFX**, featuring an interactive GUI, real-time animation, configurable simulation parameters, and statistical tracking of population dynamics and genetic diversity.
